Skills Demonstrated: *machine learning, exploratory data analysis*<br/>
Libraries and Programs: *Python, Jupyter Notebook*<br/>

Using the Titanic competition dataset available on Kaggle<sup>1</sup>, I created a model to predict which passengers would survive the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. The dataset includes passenger attributes such as Name, Age, Sex, and Economic Class, as well as information about their trip, such as their Cabin, Embarkment Location, and Ticket Price.
